# Apk Framework Detector üöÄüîç

The **Apk Framework Detector** is a sophisticated tool designed to demystify the construction of Android applications. 
It's like a forensic expert for your APK files, delving into the binary depths to reveal the secrets of its creation.

## What Does It Do? ü§î

Imagine having X-ray vision that lets you peer into the very soul of an Android app. 
That's what the **Apk Framework Detector** offers. 
It meticulously scans the APK file, looking for digital fingerprints left by the framework used during the app's development.

### The Process üîÑ

- **Extraction**: Like a skilled archaeologist, it carefully extracts the APK, ensuring every bit is preserved for analysis.
- **File Inspection**: It then sifts through the files, seeking out those unique markers that can tell us if the app speaks the language of Java, Kotlin, or something more exotic.
- **Structure Analysis**: By examining the app's structure, it can deduce whether the app was crafted with native care or with the hybrid vigor of cross-platform technologies.
- **Framework Identification**: Finally, it applies a series of tests, much like a detective looking for clues, to pinpoint the exact framework used in the app's creation.

## Why Is This Useful? üõ†Ô∏è

For developers, it's a window into the competition's soul, understanding what technologies they're using. 
For security experts, it's a way to check for potential vulnerabilities associated with certain frameworks. 
And for the curious, it's just plain cool to see the inner workings of your favorite apps.

## How to Use It üìñ

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/EngineerDanny/apk-framework-detector

# Navigate to the project directory
$ cd apk-framework-detector

# Install the necessary dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python main.py your_app.apk
```

## View the results

After running the command, the detector will provide you with a detailed report on the framework used in the APK file.
