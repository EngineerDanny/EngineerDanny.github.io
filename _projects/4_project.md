## Overview
This project involves the creation of a series of plots and graphs that represent the complex microbiome data from a scientific study.
This analysis is done on necromass data from a study in University of Minnesota.
Necromass basically refers to the dead organic matter in the soil.
The data consists of samples from different conditions (AllSoilM1M3, HighMelanM1, HighMelanM3, LowMelanM1, LowMelanM3), and the visualizations are designed to identify correlations, distributions, and patterns within a dataset.
The visualizations provide a clear and concise way to present complex data, making it accessible to a broader audience.

## Plots Description
1. **Select Absolute Correlation Threshold**: This plot shows the relationship between different correlation thresholds and the number of edges, helping to determine the strength of the connections in the data.
2. **Click Edge to Select Pair**: An interactive network diagram that allows users to explore the connections between different entities.
3. **Normalized Abundance for Selected Pair**: A scatter plot that displays the abundance of two variables over time, providing insights into their behavior and relationship.
4. **Select Sparsity or Observed Load**: This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between load and sparsity, which can be crucial for understanding the distribution of data points.
5. **Select Sparsity on Observed Load**: Similar to the third plot but with more data points, offering a detailed view of the sparsity in relation to the observed load.
6. **Select Sparsity per Load**: A line graph that represents various categories over time or another variable, highlighting the changes in sparsity with respect to the load.

## Methodology
The data was analyzed using statistical and computational techniques to extract meaningful patterns. The plots were generated using data visualization tools and libraries that support the rendering of scientific data.

## Importance
The visualizations provide a clear and concise way to present complex data, making it accessible to a broader audience. They are essential for:
- Communicating findings effectively in scientific research.
- Assisting in decision-making processes by revealing hidden trends.
- Facilitating peer review and collaborative efforts by providing a common visual language.

## Conclusion
The project showcases the power of data visualization in interpreting large datasets and emphasizes the need for effective communication in the field of data science.
